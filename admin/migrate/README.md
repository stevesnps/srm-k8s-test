# Legacy Code Dx Deployment to Software Risk Manager Migration

Code Dx was renamed the Software Risk Manager (SRM) with the 2023.8.0 release, which introduced a new deployment model that supports a separately licensed Scan Farm feature with built-in SAST and SCA scanning powered by Coverity and Black Duck.
